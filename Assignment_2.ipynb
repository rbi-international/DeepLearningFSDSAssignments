    "ANNs are inspired by biological neurons found in cerebral cortex of our brain. It is convenient to visualize neurons as arranged in layers. In addition, it can be understood that neurons in the same layer behave in the same manner.The key factors in determining the behaviour of a neuron are its activation function and the pattern in determining the behaviour of a neuron are its activation function and the pattern of weighted connections over which it sends and receives signals.. Within each layer, neurons usually have the same activation function and the same pattern of connections to other neurons. However, based on the number of layers and the pattern of connections, the NN can be of different types.\n",

    "When we build our neural network, one of the design decisions that we will need to make is what activation function to use for our neuron's calculation. Activation functions are also referred to as transfer functions or nonlinearities because they transform the linear combination of a weighted sum into a nonlinear model. An activation function is placed at the end of each perceptron to decide whether to activate this neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Different types of popular activation functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Linear transfer function**: A linear transfer function, also called as identity function, indicates that the function passes a signal through unchanged. In practical terms, the output will be equal to the input, which means we don't actually have an activation function. So no matter how many layers our neural network has, all it is doing is computing a linear activation or, at most, scaling the weighted average coming in. But it doesn't transform input into a nonlinear function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$activation(z) = z = wx + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The composition of two linear functions is a linear function, so unless we throw a nonlinear activation function in our neural network, we are not computing any interesting functions no matter how deep we make our network. No learning here!\n",

    "\n",
    "The derivative of a linear function is constant: it does not depend on the input value. This means that every time we do a back propagation, the gradient will be the same. And this is a big problem: we are not really improving the error, since the gradient is pretty much the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heavyside step function (binary classifier)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Step function produces a binary output. It basically says that if the input x > 0, it fires (output y = 1) else it doesn't fire (output y = 0). It is mainly used in binary classification problems like true or false, spam or not spam, and pass or fail.\n",

    "3. **Sigmoid/logistic functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the most common activation functions. It is often used in binary classifier to predict the probability of a class when you have two classes. The sigmoid squishes all the values to a probability between 0 and 1, which reduces extreme values or outliers in the data without removing them. Sigmoid or logistic functions convert infinite continuous variables (range between - inf to + inf) into simple probabilities between 0 and 1. It is also called the S-shape curve because when plotted in a graph, it produces an S-shaped curve. While the step function is used to produce a discrete answer (pass or fail), sigmoid is used to produce the probability of passing and proability of failing.\n",

    "4. **Softmax function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function is a generalization of the sigmoid function. It is used to obtain classification probabilities when we have more than two classes. It forces the outputs of a neural network to sum to 1 (for example, 0 < output < 1). A very common use case in deep learning problems is to predict a single class out of many options (more than two).\n",

    "\n",
    "5. **Hyperbolic tangent function (tanh)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperbolic tangent function is a shifted version of the sigmoid version. Instead of squeezing the signal values between 0 and 1, tanh squishes all values to the range -1 to 1. Tanh almost always works better than the sigmoid function in hidden layers because it has the effect of centering your data so that the mean of the data is close to zero rather than 0.5, which makes learning for the next layer a little bit easier:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tanh(x) = \\frac{sinh(x)}{cosh(x)} =  \\frac{e ^ {x} - e^{-x}}{e ^ {x} + e^{-x}}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the downsides of both sigmoid and tanh functions is that if (z) is very large or very small, then the gradient (or derivative of slope) of this function becomes very small (close to zero), which will slow down gradient descent. This is when the ReLU activation function provides a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Rectified Linear Unit**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function activates a node only if the input is above zero. If the input is below zero, the output is always zero. But when the input is higher than zero, it has a linear relationship with the output variable. The ReLU function is represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = max(0, x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of writing, ReLU is considered the state-of-the-art activation function because it works well in many different situations, and it tends to train better than sigmoid and tanh in hidden layers.\n",

    "\n",
    "7. **Leaky ReLU**\n",
    "\n",
    "One disadvantage of ReLU activation function is that the derivative is equal to to zero when (x) is negative. Leaky ReLU is a ReLU variation that tries to mitigate this issue. Instead of having the function be zero when x < 0, leaky ReLU introduces a small negative slope (around 0.01) when (x) is negative. It usually works better than the ReLU function, although it's not used as much in practice.\n",

    "A Perceptron is a linear function that produces a straight line. So to fit a non-linear data say it is in the shape of a triangle we need three perceptrons. So, we can design a neural network which has more than one neuron. We could find many different complex dataset for practice purpose on [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.26332&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false). We try to model a spiral dataset to distinguish between two classes. In order to fit this dataset, we need to build a neural network that contains tens of neurons. A very common neural network architecture is to stack the neurons in layers on top of each other, called *`hidden layers`*. Each layer has *`n`* number of neurons. Layers are connected to each other by weight connections. This leads to the multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture as shown in the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MLP](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mT4Nc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components of the neural network architecture are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Layer\n",
    "2. Hidden Layers\n",
    "3. Weight connections (edges)\n",
    "4. Output Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to fitting more complex (*i.e.* non-linear) models with neural networks is to use a more complex network that consists of more than just a single perceptron. The take-home message from the perceptron is that all of the learning happens by adapting the synapse weights until prediction is satisfactory. Hence, a reasonable guess at how to make a perceptron more complex is to simply **add more weights**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to add complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add backward connections, so that output neurons feed back to input nodes, resulting in a **recurrent network**\n",
    "2. Add neurons between the input nodes and the outputs, creating an additional (\"hidden\") layer to the network, resulting in a **multi-layer perceptron**\n",
    "\n",
    "The latter approach is more common in applications of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![multilayer](http://d.pr/i/14BS1+)\n",
    "\n",
    "How to train a multilayer network is not intuitive. Propagating the inputs forward over two layers is straightforward, since the outputs from the hidden layer can be used as inputs for the output layer. However, the process for updating the weights based on the prediction error is less clear, since it is difficult to know whether to change the weights on the input layer or on the hidden layer in order to improve the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a matter of: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. moving forward through the network, calculating outputs given inputs and current weight estimates\n",
    "2. moving backward updating weights according to the resulting error from forward propagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In this sense, it is similar to a single-layer perceptron, except it has to be done twice, once for each layer and it solves the XOR problem using these hidden layers that is many perceptrons at the same time.**"

    "It is a common saying that 'practice makes a man perfect'. Therefore, for any system to be perfect, it needs to learn and get trained. Learning can happen through interactions between two entities such as a system interacting with an environment. The way an ANN learns can be classified as follows:\n",

    "2. Unsupervised Learning\n",

    "Suppose we are training a neural network to classify using any one of these Learning methods. In first NN it was difficult to train the network for performing a task which is not linear, so several different architectures were proposed with the base being Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforced Learning methods. In any NN synaptic weights are the most important as they decide what the network will learn and how well it will learn. In first generation NN the weights were so simple chosen by simply using random weights and then multiplying the weights with the inputs. Then in second generation many new concepts came into picture which helped in classifying a pattern which in not linear in nature, e.g., a spiral pattern, XOR logic gate data points, and many more. It was a `Challenge` in the first generation as the concept of backpropagation, hidden layers, non-linear activation functions was not there. But in the second generation all these helped in the challeneg of finding out the optimized weights by which a NN learns about the relationship of the dataset so well and not only learns but it was able to generalize it as well. In third generation NN, Spiking neural networks, also called 'pulsed neural network', differentiates itself from the second generation neural networks where the information is encoded and decoded by a series of pulses (i.e., action potiential). Spiking neuron models can be classified into three main classes: (i) threshold fire, (ii) conductance-based , and (iii) compartmental models. Spike response NN model is used to forecast electrical load and is presented to validate its engineering application. This is a area of active research have a bright future."

The initial work of Warren McCulloh and Walter Pitts in a research paper that model a simple NN with electronic circuits paved the way for a new technological revolution of NN. Such NNs constitute the first-generation NNs. Afterwards, as computers emerged in the 1950s, several researchers attempted to make use of the new technology to construct enhanced NNs. After initial stage, Single layer Perceptron, then Multi-layer Perceptron with some new techniques like Backpropagation of errors so that non linear relationship between some dataset could be learned.

The `\"deep\"` in \"deep learning\" isn't a reference to any kind of deeper understanding achieved by the approach; rather, it stands for this idea of successive layers of representations. How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the *`depth`* of the model. Other appropriate names for the field could have been *`layered representations learning or hierarchical representations learning.`* Modern deep learning often involves tens or even hundreds of successive layers of representations, and they are all learned automatically from exposure to training data. Meanwhile, other approaches to machine learning tend to focus on learning only one or two layers of representations of the data (say, taking a pixel histogram and then applying a classification rule); hence, they are sometimes called shallow learning. In deep learning, these layered representations are learned via models called neural networks, structured in literal layers stacked on top of each other.\n",
